"The thing that has that kind of [Poka-yoke] "ownership" on the web is the HTTP server." --njg DM

Example footer TS just before </html>
http://www.perfdynamics.com/books.html

This example comes from my LaTeX to HTML translator:
<html>
....
<small>File translated from
T<sub><font size="-1">E</font></sub>X
by <a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/">
T<sub><font size="-1">T</font></sub>H</a>,
version 3.81.<br />On  7 Jul 2018, 19:48.</small>
</html>

W3C time tag is already defined.
A W3C algorithm would be:
* open file
* find </html> line
* goto 1 line above </html>
* If  <time datetime="2017-02-14">text</time> close file
  else insert <time datetime ... </time> tag
* close file

How would this be implemented in the HTML server?
Check Apache server devs

Anyway, I now see ur point about how to "avoid the mistake" of no TS upon publishing
 ... like automatic must be in Park or Neutral in order to start a car engine
 
 Neil Gunther
 So, poke yoke really requires *ownership* in order to be able to correct or avoid a mistake.
 
 Neil Gunther
 The thing that has that kind of "ownership" on the web is the HTTP server. If
 u, as an author, forgot to insert a TS, the web server from whence u are
 publishing, would check for that and correct it by inserting a date ... which
 would automatically be the date of publication. SOLVED !!!!
 
 Neil Gunther
 In that sense, the modern web server is the like the old-school printing press
 loaded with the date of publication on its plates.
 
 Neil Gunther
Yeah, I think it could work and should really have been mandated in the original HTTP server designs.
 
This was my feeling when I wrote the article. It has to be in the source HTML
... but wasn't sure how, if it wasn't inserted by an HTML editor (for example).
And quite honestly, that the HTTP server should do it, only came to me after
thinking how I would apply 'pokemon' to the problem. :)

HTML <time> datetime Attribute
<p>I have a date on <time datetime="2017-02-14">Valentines day</time>.</p>



This kind of protocol is governed by W3C

I like it, it would act like WordPress inserting it automatically if the user was lazy, only concern would be weird scenarios

 But thinking those can give opportunity to have all the solutions 游땙
